# Hackerrank-moderators-add-using-puppeteer
With the help of Selenium Automation Scripting, this script is used to add moderators to all of my challenges on HackerRank. 

Make a .bat file to easily run this script.

Example: 
In this script: node nameofFile.js "credentialsFileName(.json file)" "./questions.js"
